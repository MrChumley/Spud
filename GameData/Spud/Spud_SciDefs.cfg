		MeeloInSpace = The crew reports that the amazing views from high over Meelo are better for moral than the blackness of deep space.
		MeeloInSpaceLow = You look down at the surface.  The lack of craters suggest a young age.
		MeeloSrfLanded = You look up and search the sky for Kersex. Suddenly, you feel very confused.
		MeeloSrfLanded = You start to say something dramatic and poignant about the plight of Kerbal-kind in this grand universe, only to be cut off by random radio chatter that the controller is experincing déjà vu.
