{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SpudSrfLandedCraterRims = The mountainous terrain here consists of monotone colored highly dense dust and ice.
		SpudSrfLandedMidlands = The terrain here seems to have been recently disturbed.  You collect an ample sample.
		SpudSrfLandedCraters = The surface here consists of ice containing various aggrigates.  You expertly select a sample sized sample.
		SpudSrfLandedMatorMountain = You are quite sure what to do with this sample.  Resisting the urge to taste, you process, and catalogue your find.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[crewReport]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SpudInSpace = The crew reports that the amazing views from high over Spud are better for moral than the bleakness of deep space.
		SpudInSpaceLow = You look down at the surface. You note some dramatic topography.
		SpudSrfLanded = You look up and search the sky for Dres. Suddenly, you feel very aware.
		SpudSrfLanded = You start to say something well thought out, and poignant about the plight of Kerbal-kind in this grand universe, only to be cut off by urgent radio chatter that the controller is experincing déjà vu, again!
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[evaReport]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{

		SpudInSpaceHigh = You ponder the question that you came to ask.  You take a note.
		SpudInSpaceLow = You begin to question the reasons that brought you here, but move on, and focus on the task at hand.
		SpudSrfLandedCraterRims = The view is even more dramatic when you get out and look around!
		SpudSrfLandedMidlands = The ground here is rough on EVA suits.
		SpudSrfLandedCraters = The ground is kind of gritty, and slushy.
		SpudSrfLandedMatorMountain = You ponder the plight of the space potato.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SpudInSpaceHigh = The goo congeals into a gelled state.
		SpudInSpaceLow = Small nodules have formed in the gellatinous goo.
		SpudSrfLanded = Small bubble formations are noted forming in the goo.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SpudInSpaceHigh = The materials behave within nominal specifications.
		SpudInSpaceLow = The materials start displaying anomoulous anomalies.
		SpudSrfLanded = Materials at rest tend to remain at rest, unless sliding down a mountain.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SpudInSpaceHigh = Gravity scans display interesting anomalies on Spud.
		SpudInSpaceLow = Gravity feilds are a little contorted, indicating various levels of density in Spud.
		SpudSrfLandedCraterRims = Gravity readings are spiking!  Spud's eccentric orbit might be causing tidal stresses.
		SpudSrfLandedMidlands = The gravity readings show floating point errors.  You do the best you can, and make notes about the average.
		SpudSrfLandedCraters = Gravity scans indicate changes in gravitational fields as Spud rotates.
		SpudSrfLandedMatorMountain = Why would a gravity scanner read nominal when perched high on a polar mountain overlooking an interesting anomaly?
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{

		SpudSrfLandedCraterRims = You collect the seismic data.  All is quiet.  For now.
		SpudSrfLandedMidlands = Seismic scans detect some grinding action below the surface.
		SpudSrfLandedCraters = Seismic scans indicate changes slow constant movement.
		SpudSrfLandedMatorMountain = Instrument detects a constant rumbling from deep below, you wonder if you remembered to upgrade the firmware.
